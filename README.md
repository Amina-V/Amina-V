Griot: A creative personal project that will allow people to record their or their familial stories and save them to achieve lots of interesting cross-cultural stories from others.



Non-tech stuff
---------------

In my previous life, I performed as a professional "idol" in Japan's Akihabara district. It was really fun and I hope to hack on some creative projects related to girl groups soon.
