Introduction
------------
 I'm interested in Human-Computer Interaction, Affective Computing, and learning new things! Previously, I lived in Tokyo, Japan & London, England.


What I'm Working On Now
-------------------

MintStars (Head of Data): I'm the first non-C suite hire at this growth stage creator economy start-up. It's been a really fun project, and it's been amazing to see our rapid growth over the past few years.


Plurality Institute (Research): Part-time role for a mission-focused organization with the mission of facilitating collaboration between technologists in the Plurality space.


Senpai:  Coding an AI upskilling mentor with biosensing capabilities.


Griot: A creative personal project that will allow people to record their or their familial stories and save them to achieve lots of interesting cross-cultural stories from others.



Non-tech stuff
---------------

In my previous life, I performed as a professional "idol" in Japan's Akihabara district. It was really fun and I hope to hack on some creative projects related to girl groups soon.
