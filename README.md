Introduction
------------

I'm Amina, a Growth Engineer living in San Francisco, California. I'm interested in Human-Computer Interaction, and in December 2024, I'll finish a degree in the field! While visual design interests me, I'm moved to work on projects where I can deeply consider the experience of a technology user and work on making it more efficient. Previously, I lived in Tokyo, Japan & London, England.


What I'm Working On Now
-------------------

MintStars (Head of User Engagement): I'm the first non-C suite hire at this growth stage creator economy start-up. It's been a really fun project, and it's been amazing to see our rapid growth over the past few years.


Plurality Institute (Research Assistant): Part-time role for a mission-focused non-profit organization with the mission of facilitating collaboration between technologists in the Plurality space.


Senpai:  Coding an AI upskilling mentor with biosensing capabilities.


Griot (Engineer): A creative personal project that will allow people to record their or their familial stories and save them to achieve lots of interesting cross-cultural stories from others.



Non-tech stuff
---------------

In my previous life, I performed as a professional "idol" in Japan's Akihabara district. It was really fun and I hope to hack on some creative projects related to girl groups soon.
